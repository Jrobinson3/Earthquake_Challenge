# Earthquake_Challenge
# Background:
 Added earthquake data (To see the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth, and to see all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map) to a Leaflet map.  This is completed using the knowledge of JavaScript and Leaflet.js. 
# The deliverables for this Challenge are as follows:

Deliverable 1: Add Tectonic Plate Data:
This assignment was completed with tectonic_plate_logic.js under static>js folder and Tectonic Plates_Map.PNG. 
See below image for the completed map.
